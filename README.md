# ElevateLabs-task3
# Objective
The goal of this task is to implement and understand Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using a housing price dataset.
We learned to build a regression model, evaluate it using various metrics, and interpret the model’s coefficients.

# Tools Used
1. Google Colab
2. Python
3. Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

# Dataset
1. Housing Price Prediction dataset from Kaggle.
2. Columns used: (You can mention actual column names like Area, Price, or the real ones after checking).

# What I Did
1. Imported and explored the dataset.
2. Checked and handled missing values if any.
3. Selected independent (feature) and dependent (target) variables.
4. Split data into training and testing sets (80%-20% split).
5. Built a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
6. Trained the model on training data.
7. Predicted results on test data.
8. Evaluated model performance using:
   --MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   --MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   --R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
9. Plotted:
    --Actual vs Predicted points
   --Regression Line
10. Interpreted model intercept and coefficient.

# Evaluation Metrics Achieved
1. MAE: 1474748.1337969352
2. MSE: 3675286604768.185
3. R² Score: 0.27287851871974644

# Key Learnings
1. How Linear Regression works.
2. How to evaluate regression models.
3. How to visualize and interpret a regression line.
4. Importance of preprocessing and model assumptions.
